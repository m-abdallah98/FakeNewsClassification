# Fake_News_Classification
#### *1. Analyzing News data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data and Exploring different ways of word vectorization and comparing performance of different classifiers.*
#### *2. Using word embedding techniques to encode words of the headlines, the LSTM Deep learning model to extract useful information and contexts from the text data and then perform classification on it to learn to detect whether some news is fake or real.*
#### *3. Implementing new thoughts, mainly, using LSTM as a feature extactor on the text data then using this intermediate-layer output vector as an input to the Support vector machine classifier and it outperforms many other models. Also, using the Quasi-SVM NN to perform the task and visualize the performance of all those models.*
